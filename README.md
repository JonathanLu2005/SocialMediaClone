Making a social media clone

# How to run me:

## running the backend:
- open command prompt in root directory

- run `cd backend`
- on windows run `venv\scripts\activate.bat` (activates venv to keep track of modules used)
- run `python manage.py runserver`

## running the front end:

- open a command prompt in the root directory
- run `cd frontEnd`
- run `cd frontend`
- run `npm run start`

## when changing frontend:
- ensure you run ```npm run build``` in order for django to have access to your new react
